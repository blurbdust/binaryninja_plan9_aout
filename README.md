# Binary Ninja Plugin for disassembling a.out binaries.
Currently only sort-of works for amd64 and not tested for any other 
architecture yet.

TODO:
* ~Correct segmentation of binary~ maybe?
* ~Finding Strings in binary and correct loading in binja~
* Fix up function names through either loading of syscalls or through symbols
* Potential loading of symbols
* Get even remotely close to acid
